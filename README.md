Super awesome risk app

For reviewers file found [here](https://github.com/spostma5/friendly-octo-enigma/blob/main/For-Reviewers.md)

## Building and Running
The project is setup with a makefile, so a build can be triggerd with `make build`. This builds for most os configurations someone would need (probably)

## Tests
`make test` runs all the test in verbose mode (which for now is just hanlder tests)
